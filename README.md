# Gene expression levels from scRNA-Seq between smokers and non-smokers in COVID-19 Patients

## Abstract

[Muus et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.049254) investigated the correlation between ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL expression and smoking in
COVID-19 patients. As an extension to this study, this paper investigated the predictability of smoking
habits using scRNA-Seq gene expressions of COVID-19 patients. Topic modelling, logistic regression,
and random forests revealed that CTSB, CTSC, CTSL may be good predictors of smoking behaviours.
It is recommended that the authors of the original study investigate other potential genesâ€™ expressions
with smoking in COVID-19 patients and not limit their analysis to ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL.
